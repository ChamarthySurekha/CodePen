(super duper **tentative** title)

#Tinkerbox

A thingly like Dabblet, JSBin, JSFiddle, CSS Desk, and the like. Only this one open source and licensed so that you can use it commercially or host it yourself or whatever you wanna do.

##Things

- Probably best if, when running locally, you run it at a local domain like localhost.com or something (e.g. MAMP, WAMP, etc) - because there are some file paths that start with "/" and stuff.

##Server Setup

To get the server running on your machine, do the following:

    gem install bundler
    bundle install

To run the server with reload, do this

    shotgun routes.rb
